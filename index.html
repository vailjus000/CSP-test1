  <title>Sample Website #1</title>
  <body>
    <h1>My first Website</h1>
    <p>Hello World! This is my first website :o
    <p>Another paragraph of text
    <hr>
    <p>And some more text.
    Notice that spacing doesn't really matter.
    Everything is printed on one line on the page.
    Even though in teh code, these are all seperate lines.
    <p>If you want a new line, you need another paragraph
