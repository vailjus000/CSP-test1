  <title>Sample Website #1</title>
  <body bgcolor=blue>
    <h1>My first Website</h1>
    <p> This is my first website [ |o__o]
    <p>Another paragraph of text...
    <hr> 
      <p>And some more text.
      Notice that spacing doesn't really matter.
      Everything is printed on one line on the page.
      Even though in teh code, these are all seperate lines.
      <p>If you want a new line, you need another paragraph tag.
      <p>See. 
      <p>cool.
